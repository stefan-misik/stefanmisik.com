# Hello

I am a perfectionist developer, researcher, and clean code enthusiast with
passion for clarity, intellectual and mathematical rigour in technical and
scientific expression. My interests lie in many aspects of embedded and
distributed systems - ranging from research to hardware design and embedded
software implementation.

This site is my personal public note-taking platform primarily aimed at
programming and general technology related topics. These might be issues I had
hard time cracking, or things I found useful or interesting.

You can start by looking at the most recent posts below or have a look at all

**PS:** I am proud to declare that this web site is not reporting on you to the
big brother, as it is not using any google products, such as analytics, web
fonts, ads, etc.; nor is this site using any sort of tracking cookies.
